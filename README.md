## :pushpin: Final Assignment

### Design and complete a mini-project:

- Adapt the previous project or redesign a new one to meet the minimum requirements (see below)

- The circuit can be run in the Proteus simulator

- The control and monitoring application can be run in a web browser (web application)

- All sensors in the circuit can be monitored by the web application

- All actuator in the circuit can be controlled by the web application

> Check the [video #7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wb7nySQkYc) for more details and guidelines.

### Minimum requirements of the system:

- Two digital output sensors

- Two analog output sensors

- Two digital input actuators

- One PWM input actuators

#### Note:

Our simulation circuit has the followings

- 4-channel of voltage sources, the POTs (can be used as the analog output sensors)

- 4-channel of switches, the PSWs (can be used as the digital output sensors)

- 4-channel of digital output, the LEDs (can be used as the normal digital input actuators)

- 4-channel of PWM signal output, the PWMs (can be used as the PWM input actuators)

- 1-channel of Beep sound generator, the Buzzer (can be used for alarming)


#### Tasks:

- Complete the document (engineering document)

- Complete the web-based application (html, css, javascript)

- Complete the video presentation (20-30 minutes long)

#### Submission:

- Deadline: **15 May 2020**

- A **pdf document** and **source code** must be compressed as a `*.zib`, `*.rar` or `*.7-zip`

- A video presentation must be uploaded to online storage, e.g., YouTube, and send the link (URL) to the e-mail.

- Submit the compressed file and link of the video to **santi.inc.kmutt@gmail.com**

- The email title must be **INC281-GX**, where the **GX** is your group id, e.g., G1, G2,...
